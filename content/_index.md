# Welcome

Hello! My name is Daniel Boyea. I am a 2nd year masters student in astronomy at the University of Victoria. My Research interests include dark matter, little galaxies, chemical evolution, and much more. 
This site is a work in progress, so please pardon the dust.


## Research Projects {#research}

### How does the Milky Way's tides affect little galaxies?

See my post for the [Durham Small Galaxies Conference](posts/durham-2024) for a summary.

### Where does carbon come from?
While so fundamental and familiar, astronomers still are unsure of the origin of carbon in the universe. 
We know that carbon is produced in both high mass (\(\gtrsim 8 {\rm M}_\odot \)) and low mass stars, but there is no consensus on which source is dominate. 

Through models of the chemical evolution of the Milky Way, I was able to constrain which sources of

### Cosmic ray tracking
In the [HELIX](http://helix.uchicago.edu/) project, I developed an algorithm to quickly fit a circle to particle trajectories. 
The High Energy Light Isotope eXperiment (HELIX) is a balloon-borne cosmic ray
detector designed to measure the isotopic abundances of high energy cosmic
rays. 

I adapted the Hough Transform using a Gaussian smoothing to robustly fit circles to noisy trajectory data.
